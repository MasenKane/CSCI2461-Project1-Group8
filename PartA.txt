Question 1:
  If the input is 0, it will return 1. For any other input it will return 0.
  
Question 2:
  If x is greater than or equal to 0, it will return x, if x is less than 0, if will return the 2's complement (the positive number).

Question 3:
  Returns 1 if x is greater than 0, returns 0 if x is less than or equal to 0.

Question 4:
  Returns 0 if n equals 0, returns -(2^(32 - n)) if n is greater than 0 and less than 32.

Question 5:
  Returns 0 if even, returns -1 if odd.

Question 6:
  Starts with the hex number 0x55 (01010101 in binary) and turns it into the hex number 0x5555 (0101010101010101 in binary) and finally 
  turns that into the hex number 0x55555555 (01010101010101010101010101010101 in binary).

Question 7:
  Returns the highest power of 2 that the input is divisible by.

Question 8:
  Returns -1 if x is less than 0, returns 1 if x is greater than 0, and returns 0 if x equals 0.

Question 9:
  First do n % 4. If shift = 0, substitute the rightmost 8 bits of x with the rightmost 8 bits of c and 
  return that value. If shift = 1, substitute the ninth through the sixteenth bits from the right of x with the rightmost 8 bits of c and
  return that value. If shift = 2, substitute the seventeenth through the twenty-fourth bits from the right of x with the rightmost 8 bits 
  of c and return that value. If shift = 3, substitute the twenty-fifth through the final bits from the right of x with the rightmost 8 
  bits of c and return that value. 

Question 10:
  Can only return 0, because y is 1 whenever x isn't 0, and z is 1 whenever x is 0. y & z can never be 1.

Question 11:
  Returns 1 when x is negative and y is positive. Returns 0 in all other cases.

Question 12:
  Returns 1 if x is greater than m and n is greater than x. Otherwise it returns 0.

Question 13:
  Returns the number of 1s present in the binary representation of the number.

Question 14:
  Returns 1 if there are an odd number of true bits. Returns 0 if there are an even number of true bits.

Question 15:
  Masks everything but the leftmost n bits of the number x.
